description: Emocha sought a solution to provide doctors operating in impoverished countries a means of communicating and recording the success of alternative medical treatment when conventional medicine was unavailable, particularly in the treatment of TB. I worked with a cross-functional team of engineers to create a hybrid web-mobile application that could store and present medical data safely to doctors with limited access to the world wide web. </br></br>The result is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ncats.cure">CURE ID</a>, a reporting site that gathers information on how clinicians around the world are caring for patients with infectious diseases which lack adequate treatments. With the CURE Mobile App and Website, you can submit your experience treating a patient and review the experiences of other clinicians with “drug repurposing” – i.e. using existing drugs in new ways (for new diseases, in new combinations, or new doses/durations). You can also participate in discussions with a global clinical community.
